                <h1>Hi, I'm DanielüòÅüëã</h1>
                <p>
                    I am a Recent Graduate from Northeastern University seeking for Software Engineering position.
                    I am focusing on Full Stack Development (React.js and Node.js) leaning more to Front End.
                    I like to create exceptional digital experiences that are fast, accessible, visually appealing, and responsive.
                    I also like to solve problems using my skills in data structure and algorithms.
                    I have been creating several websites and doing Software-related projects for 2-3 years (inside and outside studies).
                    Regardless, I want to learn more about new things in Software as I have grown fond of it.
                </p>
