                                I have done a 6-year span of study, which includes the following:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Associate's Degree (Sep 2016 - Jun 2018): General studies, no concentration</li>
                                    <li>Bachelor's Degree (Sep 2018 - Dec 2020) : concentrated in Software Engineering</li>
                                    <li>Master's Degree (Jan 2022 - Jun 2023)   : concentrated in Software Engineering</li>
                                </ul>
                                I went to North Seattle College for my Associate's, University of Washington - Bothell campus for Bachelor's, and Northeastern University for Master's.
                                <br /><br />
                                Through all the 6 years, I have done several classes and tried different Software applications.
                                I focused on Web Development, as most of my projects are Web Development related.
